Net/FreeDB version 0.10
=======================

Net::FreeDB is an oo-based module to interface
with FreeDB servers. As of version 0.10, Net::FreeDB
is CDDB Protocol Level 6 compliant. It also includes
some basic cdrom methods to generate a cddbid and get the
required disc information required for a FreeDB
query call. These cdrom-based methods are provided
as both static and method calls.  Currently this
functionality only works on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.
If you have an OS you'd like to add, please let me know.
